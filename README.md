## About me
- Full-stack engineer who enjoys working end-to-end: product discovery, fast prototypes, scalable backends, and polished UX.
- Founding SDE at a startup while freelancing, so I juggle delivery speed, reliability, and cost every day.
- I like keeping things simple: ship small, learn fast, and iterate with real user feedback.

## Stack I ship with
- typescript · javascript · next.js · react · python · fastapi · node.js · crew ai · langchain · llm models · mongo db · supabase · express · postgresql

## Building & shipping
I build from zero: shape an idea, prototype quickly, design the right data model, wire AI where it helps, and ship with a feedback loop. I care about clarity in UX, observability in production, and keeping the stack maintainable.

## Popular learning repos
- **[Nodejs Journey](https://github.com/akshadjaiswal/Namaste-Nodejs)**: From scratch to advanced Node.js, following the Namaste Node.js series with hands-on notes.
- **[React Journey](https://github.com/akshadjaiswal/Namaste-React)**: Assignments and notes from Namaste React Live to solidify core React patterns.
- **[JavaScript Fundamentals](https://github.com/akshadjaiswal/Namaste-JavaScript)**: Quick reference for core JavaScript concepts when you need them fast.

## What I’m up to
I’m a builder who talks less and ships fast with MVPs, prototypes, and production-ready releases on a steady cadence. I care about structure, modularity, and clear docs so teams can move quickly. You’ll often find me experimenting with tools like Claude, Cursor, and Windsurf while keeping fundamentals sharp.
