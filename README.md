## 🧑‍💻 about me
- Full-stack engineer who enjoys working end-to-end: product discovery, fast prototypes, scalable backends, and polished UX.
- Founding SDE at a startup while freelancing, so I juggle delivery speed, reliability, and cost every day.
- I like keeping things simple—ship small, learn fast, and iterate with real user feedback.

## 🚀 stack I ship with
- typescript · javascript · next.js · react · python · fastapi · node.js · crew ai · langchain · llm models · mongo db · supabase · express · postgresql

## 🧭 fresh builds
- **[Excuse Generator Pro](https://github.com/akshadjaiswal/excuse-generator-pro)** — AI-powered excuse creator that stays context-aware so outputs feel human. Tweak tone and scenario to get believable, playful, or absurd excuses that don’t read like a bot.
- **[Glide Data Grid Starter](https://github.com/akshadjaiswal/glide-data-grid)** — Brownfield-friendly sandbox for Glide Data Grid. Comes with grouped headers, frozen columns, custom cells, and editing callbacks so you can test safely before dropping into a legacy app.
- **[Explain Like I’m 5](https://github.com/akshadjaiswal/explain-like-i-m-5)** — Generates four levels of explanations (beginner → expert) for any topic. Compare side-by-side to pick the right depth or share a link with teammates.
- **[Devstart CLI](https://github.com/akshadjaiswal/devstart)** — Scaffold production-ready Next.js projects in seconds: linting, testing, env wiring, and your preferred stack choices baked in from the start.
- **[Side Quest HQ](https://github.com/akshadjaiswal/side-quest-hq)** — A nostalgic hub to catalog every side project—active, paused, shipped, or abandoned—so you can see your creative trail and patterns over time.
- **[Hot Take Arena](https://github.com/akshadjaiswal/hot-takes-arena)** — Anonymous, mobile-first arena for controversial opinions. Real-time vote percentages show how divisive each take really is.
- **[JSON Craft](https://github.com/akshadjaiswal/json-craft)** — Cleanly converts JSON into TypeScript types, Zod schemas, or Prisma models with shareable links for quick collaboration.

More useful projects live in the repos tab—feel free to explore.

## 🛠️ building & shipping
I build from zero: shape an idea, prototype quickly, design the right data model, wire AI where it helps, and ship with a feedback loop. I care about clarity in UX, observability in production, and keeping the stack maintainable.

## 📚 popular learning repos
- **[Nodejs Journey](https://github.com/akshadjaiswal/Namaste-Nodejs)** — From scratch to advanced Node.js, following the Namaste Node.js series with hands-on notes.
- **[React Journey](https://github.com/akshadjaiswal/Namaste-React)** — Assignments and notes from Namaste React Live to solidify core React patterns.
- **[JavaScript Fundamentals](https://github.com/akshadjaiswal/Namaste-JavaScript)** — Quick reference for core JavaScript concepts when you need them fast.

## 🎯 what I’m up to
- Founding SDE at a startup—shipping product features, platform foundations, and AI-first experiences.
- Freelancing alongside the build to stay close to different problem spaces.
- Spinning up small, useful, and sometimes funny ideas every week to keep the creativity flowing.
